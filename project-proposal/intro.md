First an foremost, I would like to thank the Hacking History Foundation for this opportunity. The funding will absolutely allow the creation of more digital history projects and push students to be creative and important to the field of history.

For the Student Development Grant, I propose a digital history project on political cartoons from the North Korean government newspaper *Nodong Sinmun*. To note, Sinmun translates to newspaper. The *Nodong Sinmun*, has been the central state newspaper of North Korea since November 1945 to the present day.^[Zhan] It is a  daily publication that usually issues 6 pages, or 10 pages for special issues.^[Zhan] The newspapers’ publications are available at the Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library, University of Toronto <a href=https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?8534947>on physical disc drives</a>. I propose that the political cartoons from this resource be scanned, published online, and historicized for public access. There are several goals to this digitization of content from the Nodong Sinmun. First, there is an increase of accessibility of the *Nodong Sinmun*’s older publications. The online availability is well suited for researchers as well as the public, rather than being only available on physical disc drives. Second, political cartoons provide a way of resituating North Korea to the world. This is especially important for the 1950s and 1960s because it was immediately after the division of the Korean peninsula (1945 division, 1947 elections, 1953 end of the Korean War). Third, the division of the Korean peninsula in this immediate post-division period can be spatially presented through digital history. Lastly, this leads to analyzing how North Korea’s sense of self was implicated through its comparatives with the rest of the world and South Korea. The project will seek to better show how the division of North Korea and South Korea appeared as arbitrary and undefined immediately after division of the peninsula.


<h2>Historical Context</h2>

The division of the Korean peninsula is a sustaining reality from the Cold War. The first appearance of division occurred at the end of World War II (WWII). Japan annexed Korea as a colony in 1910 therefore it was relinquished following Japan’s surrender on August 11, 1945. The United States (US) and Soviet Union (USSR) came to an agreement to divide the peninsula; the north would be under the influence of the USSR as the south would be under the influence of the US. This division was at the 38th parallel. Why?

The story of this division introduces how this initial division was an arbitrary one. As WWII was ending on the night between the 10th and 11th of August 1945, two American colonels were assigned the task of deciding where to decide the peninsula. The two colonels decided on the 38th parallel in thirty minutes.^[Valérie Gelézeau] This division at the 38th parallel is not the division that is in place in the present day. The border has changed and is still an ongoing dispute; alike how the Korean War has not come to a decisive end. The end of the Korean War provided the entrenched border, marked by the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) as it is known today. In 1948, two separate elections were held in which Rhee Syngman and Kim Il Sung were elected leaders of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) respectively. The Korean War lasted from 1950-1953 and by the end of the first year, much of the fighting was stuck in the middle of the peninsula. There was a process in which the division of the peninsula was divided at this point, but it was still one that indefinitely divided Korea. Prior to the end of the Korean War, populations were moving back and forth across the ‘divided border’ showing how this division was arbitrary. The discussion on borders of Korea, especially of North Korea, is one with many opportunities for analysis that go beyond the scope of this project. For this project, the focus will be on the reception for the domestic population of Korea to accept and process a divided peninsula.
