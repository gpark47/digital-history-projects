<h2> Introduction to the Digital History Project Proposal</h2>
First and foremost, I would like to thank the Hacking History Foundation for this opportunity. The funding will absolutely allow the creation of more digital history projects and make contributions to the field of history.

For the Small Team Grant up to $50,000, I propose a digital history project on political cartoons from the North Korean government newspaper *Nodong Sinmun* (to note, *Sinmun* translates to newspaper). The *Nodong Sinmun*, has been the central state newspaper of the Korean Workers Party since November 1945 to the present day.^[[Debin Zhan, “Analysis of Changes in North Korea`s Cognition of China through Its Media Coverage,” Korean Journal of Defense Analysis 28, no.2 (2016): 202.](http://kiss.kstudy.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/thesis/thesis-view.asp?key=3436370)] It is a daily publication that usually issues 6 pages, or 10 pages for special issues.^[[ Ibid.](http://kiss.kstudy.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/thesis/thesis-view.asp?key=3436370)] The newspapers’ publications are available at the Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library, University of Toronto <a href=https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?8534947>on CD-ROM discs</a>. I propose that the political cartoons from this resource in the time period of 1957-1969 be scanned, published online, and historicized for public access. 1957 is the first year the resource begins, and 1969 is arbitrarily marked as the end of the 1960s for this project. The significance of the 1950s and 1960s will be discussed later on. The project will also focus on this select time period based on the time restriction and money recieved from the Small Team Grant. There are several goals to this digitization of content from the *Nodong Sinmun*. First, there is an increase of accessibility of the *Nodong Sinmun*’s older publications. The online availability is well suited for researchers as well as the public, rather than being only available on physical disc drives. Second, political cartoons provide a way of resituating North Korea to the world. This is especially important for the 1950s and 1960s because it was immediately after the division of the Korean peninsula (1945 division, 1948 elections, 1953 end of the Korean War). Third, the division of the Korean peninsula in this immediate post-division period can be spatially presented through digital history. Lastly, this leads to analyzing how North Korea’s sense of self was implicated through its comparatives with the rest of the world and South Korea. The project will seek to better show how the division of North Korea and South Korea appeared as arbitrary and undefined immediately after division of the peninsula. It will particularly focus on how the Korean population came to terms with division.
