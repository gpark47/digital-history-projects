# Political Cartoons of the *Nodong Sinmun*: North Korea's Relation to the World

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

The division of the Korean peninsula is a sustaining reality from the Cold War. The first appearance of division occurred at the end of World War II (WWII). Japan annexed Korea as a colony in 1910 therefore it was relinquished following Japan’s surrender on August 15, 1945. The United States (US) and Soviet Union (USSR) came to an agreement to divide the peninsula; the north would be under the influence of the USSR as the south would be under the influence of the US. This division was at the 38th parallel. Why?

The story of this division introduces how this initial division was an arbitrary one. As WWII was anticipated to end following the atomic bombings of Japan, two American colonels were assigned the task of deciding where to divide the peninsula. The two colonels decided on the 38th parallel in thirty minutes.^[[Valérie Gelézeau, “Beyond the 'Long Partition'. From Divisive Geographies of Korea to the Korean 'Meta-Culture',” European Journal of East Asian Studies 9, no. 1 (2010): 6, www.jstor.org/stable/23615261.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23615261)] This division at the 38th parallel is not the division that is in place in the present day. The border has changed and is still an ongoing dispute; alike how the Korean War has not come to a decisive end. The end of the Korean War provided the entrenched border, marked by the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) as it is known today. In 1948, two separate elections were held in which Rhee Syngman and Kim Il Sung were elected leaders of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) respectively. The Korean War lasted from 1950-1953 and by the end of the first year, much of the fighting was stuck in the middle of the peninsula. There was a process in which the division of the peninsula was divided at this point, but it was still one that indefinitely divided Korea. Prior to the end of the Korean War, populations were moving back and forth across the ‘divided border’ showing how this division was arbitrary. The discussion on borders of Korea, especially of North Korea, is one with many opportunities for analysis that go beyond the scope of this project. For this project, the focus will be on the reception for the domestic population of Korea to accept and process a divided peninsula. 

> “[T]he inter-Korean border sets both the spatial proximity of two neighbour Korean states (formerly unified people or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_ethnic_nationalism>*minjok*</a> of the peninsula) and the tremendous political and economical distance of two societies parted by over 50 years of division.”

<h2>Methods</h2>

There are several methodical components that must be completed. To begin the project, the *Nodong Sinmun* files will be acquired from the Chen Yu Tan East Asian Library. All of the files will be transferred to Dropbox so that Research Assistants' (RA) have access to the files without the disc itself. Each publication is a PDF file on the disc therefore they are easy to upload onto Dropbox for future access and dissemination. The RAs will have to go through each publication and check if there was a political cartoon issued. The RAs will compile these PDFs into a separate folder on Dropbox to access later. With 5 RAs, this process of initially sifting through the documents will take approximately 2-3 weeks. As this process is going forward, it will be the job for the RAs with Korean and Chinese reading abilities to translate the political cartoons and make note of any important accompanying articles. If an accompanying article is directly related to the cartoon (which, in most cases they are, the work will be translated as well. These translations will be double checked for accuracy as well as relevance. Because of the North Korean dialect, there may be challenges and a slower pace in which the articles are translated. This will be an ongoing process and the end to this task is unpredictable. Additional months may be needed to refine the translations and writings that will be published for the public.

The other RAs will simultaneously begin doing historical research related to the political cartoons and accompanying articles. These events can range diplomatic meetings, political affairs, reports on South Korea, or reports on the United States; all in all, the contents range from domestic to international therefore it will vary. This process will take the longest and is unpredictable as well. Many historical connections can be made therefore it will also vary on the RAs area of knowledge to engage and make connections. The RAs will produce pieces of writing on the historical context about the political cartoon and accompanying articles in a range of 100-1000 words; these will be used in the final Digital History Project. There is a wide word count range because domestic events may have little to no information available on them. However, there is an opportunity for analysis on the lack of information available here. In contrast, global affairs may have a plethora of information to research. This process of historical research will likely take the most time to complete. 
The remaining months will be dedicated to refinement and digitization. The refinement refers to editing the works written by RAs (that are about a political cartoon), as well as CSS editing. The digitization process has two key parts. 

First, the HTML and CSS must be written for the website. The main page will include a table where RAs will enter information. This key information will appear as: date of publication, keywords related to the cartoon, artist name, title (if no title, a description), key locations related to cartoon, and notes:

| Date of Publication | Keywords                                 | Artist  | Title or Description                      | Location            | Notes                                        | Link |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|------|
| December 6, 1957    | US-Korea Relations, Rhee Syngman, School | Unknown | "You even need money for a report card..." | *Dongdaemun Market* | Accompanying article criticizes Rhee Syngman | Here |

<img src="/digital-history-projects/assets/nodong-cartoon.PNG"
     alt="Nodong Sinmun Dec 6 Cartoon"
     style="float: right; margin: 10px; height: 30%; width: 35%; size: 30%" />

<img src="/digital-history-projects/assets/nodong-context.PNG"
     alt="Nodong Sinmun Dec 6 Article"
     style="float: left; margin: 10px; height: 50%; width: 60%; size: 80%" />
     
Second, if a publication is clicked on at 'here', it will redirect the user to the cartoon’s individual webpage which includes: image of the cartoon, image of the entire newspaper page, translation of the cartoon, summary of the content of the article, historical analysis, and a leaflet map with location markers of mentioned locations.


By the end of approximately 1.5 years, there will be a table that has organized *Nodong Sinmun*’s political cartoons from 1957-1969. Each cartoon will have its own page with historical context, images, and a leaflet map. The usage of a leaflet map is an important part of the Digital History project. The dynamic, interactive leaflet map allows the user to engage with the Korean peninsula spatially. This removes static frames around what areas are a part of the conversation around North Korea. Importantly, the leaflet map will limit the amount of present-day information (e.g., roads, points of interest) because it is presenting the 1950s and 1960s. It also reinforces the idea that the division between North Korea and South Korea is one that must be approached critically. The divided developments of today cannot be projected onto a map of the past. In addition, spatial history integrates North Korea in connection with the world, rather than prescribe a sense of isolation onto them, especially in a period immediately following division. 

This online website will be available for public access.

<h2>Timeline</h2>

The CD-ROM discs can be acquired from the Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library at any time. Therefore, this project can start immediately after recieving funding (even during the COVID-19 pandemic). The first stage of transferring PDF files from the discs to Dropbox can be done using library computers or at home by the RAs. Because the project can start at any time, there are no specific months listed in this timeline.

<h2>Budget</h2>
There is no noteable expenses that are required for this project (e.g., travel). The funding for this project is justified because it will go to RA wages. The RAs are involved in a research and labour intensive process. Online work through Dropbox will not require additional costs.

<h2>Why should this project be funded?</h2>

Analyzing political cartoons from a North Korean newspaper appears as a very specific project. However, this specificity arises with context. Although there is a lot not known about North Korea, there are in fact many resources available to do research on North Korea. The *Nodong Sinmun* is especially valuable because it has been a daily publication from 1945 to the present day; this demonstrates how much content has been produced to look at. It is important to take these resources from a purely academic space (i.e., in the library on a CD-ROM disc) and move them to a public, online space. Access to these works opens up new opportunities for the public, students, and researchers alike to view these primary sources. Political cartoons are especially an interesting form of visual culture that the public can understand. Importantly, they can even laugh at it. Each of the following goals presents reasons why this Digital History Project should be funded: 

The first goal of this project is to have more people engage with critical questions in approaching North Korea. The role of spatial history is especially important in this section. The political cartoons range from topics of sports to politics. This allows cartoons and articles to cover many geographical spaces. There are two key points here. First, it is interesting to bring forward how North Korea situated themselves in the world through newspapers. The way in which sporting events or political events are framed, showcase the way the state framed the country to its citizens. In a post-divided context, this method of legitimization is important in how citizens came to terms with a shift from a unified Korea to a divided one. Second, the way North Korean political cartoons engage with South Korea further showcase a process of coming to terms with the division. The leaflet map will visually showcase to users (many who are likely, not familiar with Korean geography) what places are being mentioned in the newspaper. By showing that ***Dongdaemun Market in Seoul*** is being mentioned, it will show **visually** that topics of these cartoons are constantly crossing the divided space.

*[I utilized Google Maps to help visualize the use of the leaflet map. Leaflet is the preferred choice because the map itself can be customized. It would be better suited for this project to remove most of the modern aspects as this project focuses on the 1950s and 1960s. I was unsure of how to integrate leaflet into this proposal.]*


As introduced through the historical context, there was movement across the border up until 1953. Therefore, how does the North Korean audience engage with this cartoon? How is this title of a ‘North Korean audience’ also prescribed based on over 50 years of division in the present day? Again, reiterating the post-divided context is important to engaging with how overtime, a mental distance has been created between the two Koreas which are still spatially connected. This also reiterates the significance of focusing on the 1950s and 1960s, the decades following the peninsula’s division.

To continue, this leads to the second goal of this project: overcoming assumptions. It is rather easy to approach North Korea with assumptions, especially with the type of media coverage and approaches that are taken about the country. One specific attitude that is fallen back on is that the citizens are all ‘brainwashed’. This is a very sweeping, generalizing, and inappropriate way to approach any historical study. Yet, it appears as a very common way to approach North Korea. This is why this project is important in attempting to engage people into re-evaluating their own approaches to North Korea. On a study of Pyeongyang metro art, Gabriel Douglas states that “art… opens up spaces of interpretive ambiguity.”^[[Douglas Gabriel, “Revolution from 360 Feet Below: Form and Ideology in the Pyongyang Metro,” Journal of Korean Studies, 23. 1 (March 2018): 112.](https://muse-jhu-edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/696658#.X9e7z2FeAg4.link)] Douglas is introducing the idea that visual culture needs interpretation and engagement from the audience itself. The political cartoons in the *Nodong Sinmun* do not simply exist to be consumed blindly but are an active form of two-way communication between the reader, the artist, and arguably, the state. In fact, works about political cartoons emphasize this very type of communication in its creation, reception, and context of creation. The most obvious part of a political cartoon will be what/who it is trying to criticize. What is less obvious and important is the audience the cartoonist is attempting to reach.^[[Charles Press, The Political Cartoon (Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1981), 62.](http://go.utlib.ca/cat/4371951)] It is important because the artist finds themselves apart of this audience, and the cartoonist simultaneously knows that this audience exists; that is, that people will understand and laugh at the cartoon.^[[ Ibid.](http://go.utlib.ca/cat/4371951)]

In applying these analyses to the Nodong Sinmun, several questions arise:
How is the artist approaching their political criticism? What are the trends in approaches over the years? How can we mediate the author, the state, and the audience? How do the accompanying articles influence and shape the audience’s perceptions/reactions? And to be more specific, how does the approach towards South Korea change overtime? How does time's linear distance from ‘division’ impact these approaches to South Korea? Importantly, how does the approach to South Korea implicate on how North Korea perceives itself? By this question, it is referring to ideas of referring to divided Korea (North and South) versus a unified Korea. 

This leads to the last key goal of this Digital History Project. It is asking the question: What are the implications on North Korea’s sense of self? It has been emphasized that the approach of this project is to grapple with questions of division. 

>Craig Mackie states that: 
>>“[D]uality in the formulation of Korean ‘nationness,’ the separation of ‘Korea’ into a ‘North’ Korea and a ‘South’ Korea, can never be forgotten in any discussion of the Korean national consciousness.”^[[Craig Mackie, “Familial communism and cartoons: An affective political economy of North Korea,” in The Political Economy of Affect and Emotion in East Asia, ed. Jie Yang, 223 (New York: Routledge, 2014).](http://go.utlib.ca/cat/9865179)]

Ultimately, it is important to return back to the first goal of this project again which is to emphasize the spatial history of North Korea in grappling with division. It should be reworded to say that this project deals with the spatial history of the Korean peninsula (not just North Korea). As Mackie states, this constant comparison of North Korea and South Korea to each other and to the rest of the world, leaves each country in a tension of identity. By stating that South Korea exists, North Korea legitimizes itself as the ‘proper’ Korea while also creating an identity based on the existence against the South. This adds to another layer of critically thinking about how political cartoons approach South Korea over the course of nearly two decades. 

Newspapers are a valuable primary source to track these changes. Political cartoons especially, provide layers of analysis in these processes of mediation. To summarize, this Digital History Project is important because:
* It allows more access to primary sources for the public, students, and researchers
* Critically engages with how North Korea framed world events
* Attempts to resituate peoples’ assumptions about North Korea, especially about the relationship between the citizens and the state
* Provides a spatial history to the division of Korea to help further understand the tension between being spatially connecting but socially/culturally separated
* Traces changes of approaches and attitudes overtime (e.g., to world affairs, to South Korea, to the United States), starting from the point of division

Perhaps the most invaluable part of this project is how many questions it raises. As seen from the list of 5 important points above, there are many ways to engage with this project. What this means is that if this Digital History Project is completed, people who find it will always take something away from it. 

In conclusion, the digital history format allows for political cartoons of the *Nodong Sinmun* to be utilized in ways that benefit the space of public history. The spatial history component is especially significant to providing a visual understanding of Korea as a connected space even through its division. It is especially important in contrast to simply, a teleological learning of Korea from ‘united’ to ‘divided’. If this project is successful, it can continue with more work on later issues of the *Nodong Sinmun* up to the present day. Afterall, what defines division? And at what point was or is Korea divided? Spatially, yes there is a border. But this border is always in contention. So then, what else marks a divided Korea? This project will tackle the 1950s and 1960s to deal with these questions, but it is also a project worth funding because of its continuing possibilities. 

Thank you for your time. I hope you hear from you soon.
