# The Spatiality of Hiroshima Peace Park and Nagasaki Peace Park

This project will explore how the spatiality of each memorial impacts how the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are remembered. 

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, before the map and buttons. To change the colors, modify the defaults in [style.css](../css/map-styles.css).
