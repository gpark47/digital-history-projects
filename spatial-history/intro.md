# The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

Amidst World War II (WWII) on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. On August 9, 1945, the United States then dropped another atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki, Japan. These two events are remembered in the standard WWII narrative as markers of the end of the war; Emperor Hirohito officially surrendered days later on August 11, 1945. 

This project will explore how the spatiality of each memorial impacts how the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are remembered. 

Memorials are not only a physical site of remembrance, it is a site of pilgrimage, journeys, and interaction. People travel to memorial sites every year to commemorate a historical event or more personal, passing of loved ones. In addition, memorials have become tourist destinations in their own right, attracting thousands and millions of visitors each year. 

> "The act of remembering is always mediated by and inseparable from the positions that one establishes in relation to social and political arrangements, in both the present and the future. At the same time, like a negative dialectic, the work of remembering is inevitably enabled by an accompanying process of forgetting."
